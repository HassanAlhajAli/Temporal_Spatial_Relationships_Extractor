# Temporal_Spatial_Relationships_Extractor
This project involves creating and extending templates for extracting temporal and spatial relationships from Arabic biographical texts using NLP techniques, including data collection via web scraping and applying templates through Farasa-based entity recognition and regular expressions.

The system extracts relationships like birth and death dates and places.


The methodology involves:

1. Identifying linguistic templates used to represent these relationships.
2. Expanding templates using dictionaries or ArabicWordNet.
3. Building a document set for extracting relationships.
4. Applying templates to extract relationships.
5. Evaluating the extracted relationships.
6. Studying system errors.
